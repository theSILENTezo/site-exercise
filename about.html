                    Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? <br>
                    I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. <br>
                    It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, <br>
                    so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the <br>
                    midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark <br>
                    side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. <br>
                    The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some <br>
                    consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing <br>
                    he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, <br>
                    he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, <br>
                    then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. <br>
                    Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself. <br>
